Kotlin OO Boot Camp in Kotlin for Montreal client - 25 March - 5 April 2019

Kotlin is relatively easy to setup with IntelliJ IDEA. The following instructions are for installing
the code in IntelliJ 2018 by JetBrains. Adapt as necessary for your environment.

## IntelliJ setup
Note: The original was setup to use Kotlin 1.1, Java SDK 11, and JUnit 5-style for testing.

Open the reference code:

- Download the source code from github.com/fredgeorge
  - Clone, or pull and extract the zip
- Open IntelliJ
- Choose "Open"
- Navigate to the reference code root, and enter

Source and test directories should already be tagged as such. Confirm or fix:

- File/Project Structure...
- Select "Modules"
  - Tag src directory as Sources in *exercises* module
  - Tag test directory as Tests in *tests* module
  - Click "OK"

Confirm that everything builds correctly (and necessary libraries exist)
